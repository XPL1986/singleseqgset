\title{singleseqgset: Single-cell Gene Set Enrichment Analysis}
\description{
This package takes single-cell gene expression data and lists of gene sets, and tests whether specific clusters have enrichment for the given gene sets compared to other clusters. To accomplish this, we implement a Wilcoxon Mann Whitney correlated-corrected statistic inspired by CAMERA to compare genes within the gene set versus genes outside of the gene set (see Camera: a competitive gene set test accounting for inter-gene correlation by Wu and Smyth, Nucleic Acids Research 2012 for more information).
